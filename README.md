# Bronco Build Tracker
When Ford is building a Bronco that is a special order there is are a few tracking website
to show the progress. I have been waiting for my Bronco build and instead of refreshing the 
pages on every opportunity, I wrote some Bash scripts to notify me of changes. To share this
capability and take an opportunity to play with Go, I created this. Please forgive the overall
quality as it is more of a toy than anything. It might be useful, but it comes with no guarantees.

Privacy is important, so I have published the source here to make it clear that no sensitive information
leaves you computer system. You do not need to share any of your info with any external service (other than
the Ford services that this tool interacts with, of course.)

The status websites (names for trackers came from my friends at https://www.bronco6g.com/):
- The "Pizza Tracker" is sent to you when you get a VIN (https://shop.ford.com/vehicleordertracking)
- There is a link to a Window Sticker PDF on the "Pizza Tracker"
- The "Backdoor Tracker" is a reservation tracker from Ford (https://www.ford.com/buy/manage.html?reservationId=xxxxxxx)

The app will:
- Check the Pizza Tracker and track progress
- Check the window sticker link and track changes
- Check the Backdoor Tracker and track progress 
- Notify you of changes via Textbelt or Pushover
- Run the checks on a regular interval

The app will only do the things that it has configuration for. It will skip any steps that are not configured.

There will be two files created in the same directory as the application:
- settings.json - This will contain all the application settings. It will contain personal info
so do not share it with anybody.
- state.json -  This will hold information about the state of your build and is safe to share.

The program will prompt for settings or you can provide them
with CLI options.

## Getting started
Fair warning - This is not made to be easy for non-technical people. I think with a little effort
almost anybody can get it working, but ut may take some work or learning.

Note: This app stays running and if you want to keep it going you all the time you need to make sure your
computer doesn't go to sleep! If it doesn't you will not get notified.
### Mac
- Download the `bronco-build-tracker-darwin-amd64` binary from the releases
- You can double-click on the download and it will open a terminal and start running (or run in from the terminal if you know how to)
- Answer the questions the app asks you (VIN, Order ID, etc.)
- Let it run
### Linux
- Download the `bronco-build-tracker-linux-arm` or `bronco-build-tracker-linux-amd64` based on your process from the releases
- Run it from the terminal using and answer the questions or use the flags
- If you want it to run in the background do something like `nohup ./bronco-build-tracker-linux-arm &`
- Let it run (to stop it you can find the process using `ps -ef | grep bronco` and then `kill` the process)
### Windows 
__I have not tested this, so feedback would be great...at least let me know if it works__
- Download the `bronco-build-tracker-windows-amd64.exe` binary from the releases
- Double-click on it?
- Answer the questions the app asks you (VIN, Order ID, etc.)
- Let it run

## Configuration
### Textbelt
Textbelt provides a way to send SMS messages from apps like this.
If you would like to receive SMS notifications you need to setup textbelt.
You do have to pay for the notifications, but it is cheap. 
For Textbelt notifications, setup a key and pay for text messages
at http://textbelt.com. You can get 50 texts for $3

### Pushover
For Pushover notifications, download the app and go to http://pushover.net
and setup a token and user. The app is $5 one time fee (free for 1 month)
and 10,000 notification per month for free.

### Getting a refresh token
A refresh token is part of the OAuth authentication method used to login to 
the Ford website. This token has a long lifespan and will allow us to grab 
the info we need. Please note, never share your token with anybody else as this
could compromise your account! Getting this token might prove difficult if you are not familiar with
this kind of thing, but it is interesting because it is very reliable and exposes the vehicleStatusCode
that seems to change more often than the visual components of the two tracker...although I don't know 
what the values mean yet.
To get the token:
- Go to https://www.ford.com/buy/manage.html?reservationId=xxxxxx (using your reservation ID) in Chrome
- Right-click on the page and select "Inspect"
- Login
- Click on the Network tab in the pane that opened up when you clicked "Inspect"
- In the filter in the top left section of the pane type "api.mps.ford.com"
- In the list of requests, there will be two with the name "token". Click on the second one and look at 
the Preview sub-pane
- Find the value of the refresh_token field and you will have the value
